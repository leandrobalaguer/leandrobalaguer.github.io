About
I started working for advertising and television, way ago. In addition to writing creative copy and scripts, I’ve work in many senior creative roles, mostly as a Producer, Art Director and Videographer. Mainly defining the visual design of a project - from initial exploration to final deliverables with a realistic sense of beauty. Both, independently and as a part of agencies around the world. 

I work really hard to keep all my collaborations fun, light and enjoyable treating others with the due respect. Just that. But many times, that´s all you need to make a difference.
